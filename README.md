CONSTITUIONAL AWARENESS DEDICATED INTELLIGENT SEARCH ENGINE (CADISE)

This system enables easy querying of the constitutional information
as and when needed by the user. The solution has been achieved greatly by the use of machine

qualified legal representatives registered on the system.
The system is projected to be a time-saving data retrieval tool for legal information
for academic and professional use. It should also be easily scaled up to a variety of information
